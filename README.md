# streamdeck
3D printed USB streamdeck

This project is a remake of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4186055 based on an Arduino Pro Micro and HID capabilities

My current keys assignment (under Linux) is the following: it can be fully customized by printing the relevant keycaps and configuring the shortcuts using your preferred OS.

```
1       mute mic
2       mute speaker
3       audio pause
4       audio prev
5       audio next
6       volume down
7       volume up
8       screen capture
9       window capture
10      spectacle
11      keyboard layout switcher
12      custom key 1
13      custom key 2
14      run konsole
15      screensaver
```
